NAME
    SWISH::API::Common - SWISH Document Indexing Made Easy

SYNOPSIS
        use SWISH::API::Common;

        my $swish = SWISH::API::Common->new();

            # Index all files in a directory and its subdirectories
        $swish->index("/usr/local/share/doc");

            # After indexing once (it's persistent), fire up as many
            # queries as you like:

            # Search documents containing both "swish" and "install"
        for my $hit ($swish->search("swish AND install")) {
            print $hit->path(), "\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    "SWISH::API::Common" offers an easy interface to the Swish index engine.
    While SWISH::API offers a complete API, "SWISH::API::Common" focusses on
    ease of use.

    THIS MODULE IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE API MIGHT CHANGE AT ANY
    TIME.

    Currently, "SWISH::API::Common" just allows for indexing documents in a
    single directory and any of its subdirectories. Also, don't run index()
    and search() in parallel yet.

INSTALLATION
    "SWISH::API::Common" requires "SWISH::API" and the swish engine to be
    installed. Please download the latest release from

        http://swish-e.org/distribution/swish-e-2.4.3.tar.gz

    and untar it, type

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    and then install SWISH::API which is contained in the distribution:

        cd perl
        perl Makefile.PL
        make 
        make install

  METHODS
    $sw = SWISH::API::Common->new()
        Constructor. Takes many options, but the defaults are usually fine.

        Available options and their defaults:

                # Where SWISH::API::Common stores index files etc.
            swish_adm_dir   "$ENV{HOME}/.swish-common"

                # The path to swish-e, relative is OK
            swish_exe       "swish-e"

                # Swish index file
            swish_idx_file  "$self->{swish_adm_dir}/default.idx"

                # Swish configuration file
            swish_cnf_file  "$self->{swish_adm_dir}/default.cnf"

                # SWISH Stemming
            swish_fuzzy_indexing_mode => "Stemming_en"

                # Maximum amount of data (in bytes) extracted
                # from a single file
            file_len_max 100_000

                # Preserve every indexed file's atime
            atime_preserve
        
    $sw->index($dir, ...)
        Generate a new index of all text documents under directory $dir. One
        or more directories can be specified.

    $sw->search("foo AND bar");
        Searches the index, using the given search expression. Returns a
        list hits, which can be asked for their path:

                # Search documents containing 
                # both "foo" and "bar"
            for my $hit ($swish->search("foo AND bar")) {
                print $hit->path(), "\n";
            }

    index_remove
        Permanently delete the current index.

TODO List
        * More than one index directory
        * Remove documents from index
        * Iterator for search hits
